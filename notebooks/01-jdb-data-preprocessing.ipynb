    "    - Loading the SQuAD data\n",
    "    - Tokenization with Stanford CoreNLP\n",
    "    - Embeddings with GloVe, pretrained on 840B Common Crawl, fixed\n",

    "In the end, we require a 2 x n array containing the input data and target for each question-answer pair. The target here is [UNRESOLVED, see questions]. The input data for each example consists of a paragraph and a question, and each are encoded in word vectors. This means both are matrices of p x l and q x l, where p is the number of words in the paragraph, l the length of the word embeddings, and q the number of words in the question. Whether these can be concatenated or should be separate items in an array is [UNRESOLVED, see questions]"
